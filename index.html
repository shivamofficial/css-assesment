    <p>when comparing class vs ID , the difference is that css class applies a style to multiple element.ID, on the other hand ,applies a style to onr unique element.Id is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and its used by javascript.</p>
    <p>In CSS , selector are used to target or range of element on a web page. once an element has been targeted ,a style or set of style can be applied to the element.
        <p>There is a wide range of selector available .two of the most commonly used are class and ID .Both are used to targeted element to which A  style should be applied </p>
